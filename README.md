<h1> SocialMediaApp </h1>
A Social Media App which U can use to find some lost contacts due to workloads and all other stuffs. This App helps u out to take one stride for reconcile.

<h2> API:-</h2> An API is a set of programming instructions and standards for accessing a web tool or database. A software company releases its API to the public so other software developers can design products that are powered by its service. The API is usually packaged in an SDK.

<h2>Firebase:-</h2> Firebase is a mobile platform that helps you quickly develop high-quality apps, grow your user base, and earn more money. Firebase is made up of complementary features that you can mix-and-match to fit your needs, with Google Analytics for Firebase at the core. You can explore and integrate Firebase services in your app directly from Android Studio using the Assistant window

<h2>Library:-</h2> A library module is useful in the following situations:

When you're building multiple apps that use some of the same components, such as activities, services, or UI layouts.
When you're building an app that exists in multiple APK variations, such as a free and paid version and you need the same core components in both.

<h2>Repository:-</h2> A repository mediates between data sources (such as persistent models, web services, and caches) and the rest of the app. The diagram below shows how app components such as activities that use LiveData might interact with data sources by way of a repository.

<h2>Coroutines:-</h2> On Android, coroutines help to manage long-running tasks that might otherwise block the main thread and cause your app to become unresponsive. Over 50% of professional developers who use coroutines have reported seeing increased productivity. This topic describes how you can use Kotlin coroutines to address these problems, enabling you to write cleaner and more concise app code.

Features
Coroutines is our recommended solution for asynchronous programming on Android. Noteworthy features include the following:

**Lightweight:** You can run many coroutines on a single thread due to support for suspension, which doesn't block the thread where the coroutine is running. Suspending saves memory over blocking while supporting many concurrent operations.

**Fewer memory leaks:** Use structured concurrency to run operations within a scope.

**Built-in cancellation support:** Cancellation is propagated automatically through the running coroutine hierarchy.

**Jetpack integration:** Many Jetpack libraries include extensions that provide full coroutines support. Some libraries also provide their own coroutine scope that you can use for structured concurrency.


<h2>Recycler View:-</h2> RecyclerView is a ViewGroup added to the android studio as a successor of the GridView and ListView. It is an improvement on both of them and can be found in the latest v-7 support packages. It has been created to make possible construction of any lists with XML layouts as an item which can be customized vastly while improving on the efficiency of ListViews and GridViews. This improvement is achieved by recycling the views which are out of the visibility of the user.

**Implementation:** To implement a basic RecyclerView three sub-parts are needed to be constructed which offer the users the degree of control they require in making varying designs of their choice.

**The Card Layout:** The card layout is an XML layout which will be treated as an item for the list created by the RecyclerView.

**The ViewHolder:** The ViewHolder is a java class that stores the reference to the card layout views that have to be dynamically modified during the execution of the program by a list of data obtained either by online databases or added in some other way.

**The Data Class:** The Data class is a custom java class that acts as a structure for holding the information for every item of the RecyclerView.
